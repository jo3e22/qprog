!* This is an unpublished work created in 2015. It may be copied,             *
!* distributed and used as set out in the standard terms and conditions for   *
!* use of IMAS software.                                                      *

!* Since these conditions had not been finalised at time of delivery, there   *
!* is the rider that IMAS terms and conditions are expected to exclude the    *
!* use of the software for activities unrelated to the ITER project.          *
!* As an interim measure, it is here explicitly stated that this software     *
!* must not be used for for nuclear reactor design activities unrelated to    *
!* ITER  without the express written consent of UKAEA.                        *
